# Java Medical Center System

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based Medical Center Management System.  
The system simulates a real-world medical center workflow, providing role-based access and interactions.  
It includes four main roles: **Manager**, **Staff**, **Doctor**, and **Customer**, each with specific responsibilities.

- **Manager** – Can add new Staff and Doctors.  
- **Doctor** – Can accept customer appointments and provide feedback.  
- **Staff** – Can make appointments for customers and handle payments based on doctor's prescriptions.  
- **Customer** – Can request appointments and provide feedback for doctors.  

This system demonstrates role-based interactions and the management of appointments, feedback, and billing within a medical center environment.
